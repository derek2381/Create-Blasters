Create Blasters: An Explosive Object Blasting Adventure
I'm excited to present my latest project â€“ "Create Blasters," an exhilarating object blasting game developed using Unity. In this game, players toss various objects into the air and earn points by blasting the 'good' creates while avoiding the 'bad' skull objects.
Key Features:

Categorized Objects

Objects are classified as 'good' creates or 'bad' skulls
'Good' creates have positive point values
'Bad' skull objects have negative point values


Explosive Blast Animations

When blasted, 'good' creates and 'bad' skulls burst with unique animations
Enhances the gameplay experience with exciting visual effects


Difficulty Levels

Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard
Each level increases the challenge for players
Allows players to progress at their own pace


Engaging Gameplay Mechanics

Players must accurately blast 'good' creates to earn points
Missing a 'good' create results in a loss
Restart button allows players to try again



Throughout the development process, I honed my skills in Unity, object interactions, animations, and user interface design. This project challenged me to create a dynamic and responsive game environment, implement object categorization logic, and integrate difficulty levels.
I am thrilled with the result of "Create Blasters" and look forward to continuing my journey in game development, exploring new techniques and ideas to create even more engaging and immersive gaming experiences.
Feel free to check out the project and provide any feedback or suggestions!
